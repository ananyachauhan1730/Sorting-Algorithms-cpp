Aim: To study and implement Sorting Algorithm

i) Selection Sort

ii) Insertion Sort

iii) Bubble Sort

Theory:

A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.

Selection Sort

In selection sorting technique, the smallest element is fetched by comparing itself with the rest of the elements and sorted at the array's first position. The complete array is divided into two halves, the sorted subarray on the left and the unsorted subarray on the right. Once the first element is sorted, the search for the second minimum element begins from the rest of the array and is positioned at second place.

Insertion Sort

In this sorting technique, the elements are sorted by comparing the elements with their previous elements. It starts by comparing the second element with the first element. If the second element is smaller than the first, then we will swap it.After that, we will compare the third element with all the elements that are before it. Similarly, it goes for the fourth element and so on. Once all the comparisons are made, the elements become sorted.

Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is one of the most straightforward sorting algorithms. In this sorting technique, we begin by comparing the first two elements of the array and checking if the first element is greater than the second element; if it is, we will swap those elements and move forward to the next element.
